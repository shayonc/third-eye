## Inspiration
_"I cannot see and explore the world with both my eyes, what if I could have a third eye that can help me with that..."_   

Tom is an 18-year-old boy with a visual impairment. He wishes he could explore things around, just like other people who can see the world. One day, he happened to get the chance to try ThirdEye, the smart glasses designed for blind people to explore the surroundings just like a third eye...  

## What it does 
Third Eye is the computer vision assistant for the visually impaired or the blind with the goal to create an affordable wearable device that uses live video feed from the glassesâ€™ camera to identify and warn users of obstacles, facial recognition to tell them who it is that is in front of them, and lets them know what the object is using computer vision. Using cutting edge technology of depth perception, cloud processing, computer vision, and speech to text machine learning software, Third Eye provides another level of freedom for those who have lost a sense and giving them a new one, the Third Eye.

## How we built it
We use the Raspberry Pi Suite of the Pi Camera, distance and depth Pi sensor, and wireless microphone for the purpose of feeding live video feed for computer vision analysis, object classification, distance/potential obstacle analysis, and facial recognition. The hardware side was mostly programmed in Python while the servers and the cloud based processing were programmed in PHP and working with tools such as Google video intelligence API. 

## Challenges we ran into
The first problem we encountered was the lack of hardware such as a raspberry pi camera and a SIM card so we could not boot up the Raspberry Pi for the first day throwing our plans and time schedule to ciaos. But with multitasking, giving up some features in the race of time, and flexibly adapting to the change allowed us to end with a working product although not to our highest satisfaction.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
We combined the hardware and the cloud! With little sleep, we tried the best!

## What we learned
We learned how to use the Raspberry Pi Suite for the live video feed for computer vision analysis, object classification, distance/potential obstacle analysis, and facial recognition. We also learned how to work with Python on the servers and the cloud based processing in PHP as well as tools such as Google video intelligence API. Last but now least, teamwork! 

## What's next for Third Eye
Incorporating further learning algorithms and training to continue to improve recognition of objects and facial features of people. We will continue to also improve our speech recognition AI and location direction instructions to be more descriptive.
